# ITK-Filtering-Experiments

This repo contains experiments relating to image processing and filtering in ITK. 

A 2D RGB image serves as input, which is converted to grayscale and corruped with noise via an `itkAdditiveGaussianNoiseImageFilter`. The figure below shows the original and noisy image with a standard deviation of 50.

## Denoising with a Gaussian Filter

The noisy image is denoised with several values of **Ïƒ**.

## Denoising with a Median Filter

The noisy image is denoised with a median filter with several neighborhood sizes.
